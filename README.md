# MROS
Here I'm trying to create a boot, I hope the project to get bigger and bigger to become a small OS.
V0.0 : print , scan user input and clear screen functions in real mode.
Its very easy to use them just load the address of the Input/Output in bx register and call _print_func/_scan_input, _cls does not need any param.
